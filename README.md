# Real-Time-Human-Activity-Recognition-stacked-LSTMs-OPENPOSE-
This project is based on work done by felixchenfy ( Real Time Action Recognition ) and stuarteiffert ( RNN for Real Time Action recognition using 2D pose input)  . The Real time interface that is created by the former creator is combined with the classification architecture (stacked LSTMs) done by  latter creator.
